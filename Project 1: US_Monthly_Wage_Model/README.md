# Project 1: US Monthly Wage Prediction

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow to predict monthly wages in the US. It combines intensive **data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modelling** to generate actionable insights.

## Project Overview

- **Code**: Contains detailed steps for data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modelling. Several machine learning models were evaluated to identify the best performing approach for wage prediction.  
- **Report**: Provides a comprehensive explanation of the dataset, descriptive statistics, visual EDA results, model evaluation, and interpretation of outcomes. It also includes business implications, strategy recommendations, and suggestions for further studies.

## Key Highlights

- Conducted **intensive EDA** to uncover patterns and relationships in the data  
- Performed **feature engineering** to improve model performance  
- Implemented multiple **predictive models** and selected the most accurate  
- Analysed results to provide **business-relevant insights** and recommendations  
- Documented findings in a structured **report** for clear communication

## Outcomes

This project highlights how **data-driven approaches** can inform business strategies by predicting employee wages, understanding key factors influencing compensation, and suggesting actionable insights for HR and policy decisions.
