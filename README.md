# Project-Portfolio
I created this portfolio to showcase my CV and the analytics and IS projects that have shaped my learning journey. It includes machine learning models, supply chain optimisation models, Tableau dashboards, and Python scripts developed throughout my Business Analytics &amp; Information Systems studies.
